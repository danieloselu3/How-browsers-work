A web browser is actually a software app that runs on your internet computer,it allows one to view web pages,as well as use other tech such as videos,graphics
The primary purpose of the browser is to bring info resources to the user,allowing them to view the info displayed,and then access them.
The web browsers contain two main parts,HTTP [Hypertext transfer protocol] which enables web severs and web users to communicae,URL[uniform resource locater] which indicates protocol to use,and specifies which IP address the resource is located.
some commonly used browsers include google chrome,internet explorer,safaris, UC browsers,Opera mini.

As soon as an address is typed into the browsers address bar,some communication begins.The browser sends an HTTP request through the internet to where the servers that run the website are located.
The HTTP request contains three parts,
      -Request line: this includes the command,web page request,and the HTTP version number.
      -Request header: this includes the browser in use,date,and some other info.
      -Request body:this includes the info that was sent to the server[usually optional].
Upon receiving the request,the web server then sends back an HTTP response which is read by the browser to display the site.The response also contains;
      -Response status:contains HTTP version,status code,and reason phrase[description of status code]
      -Response header:[optional]includes servers used,date,URL of web page. 
The response contains the website in HTML[Hypertext Markup Language] form which the browsers translates to display the complete site as viewed from the screen.
HTML is just a language used to design websites,and is made up of elements sorrounded by tags.

When we are online,behind the screens,our browsers are constantly at work communicating with servers around the world to display the sites we request.These processes repeat everytime we click a link,at amazingly less than a second.
